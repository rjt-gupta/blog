# Kharagpur Winter of Code (KWoC) Experience

KWoC is a program initiated by KOSS a.k.a Kharagpur Open Source Society. This open-to-all program is for students who want to get started with opensource world and to learn about how to contribute on Github!

The actual benefit of participating in such programs is you get to know different people, you make connections a lot and ofcourse you learn a lot.

I found out about KWoC through a friend. My major motive was to get aquainted with git and github (even though I have done some personal projects) for GSoC. Through this I got to know many things about Open Source Culture.


## Project

I am passionate about Information Security so I selected <a href="https://github.com/abhisharma404/vault_scanner">**<u>VAULT</u>**</a> from a list of more than 100 projects which is a **Swiss Army Knife for Hackers**. I communicated with my mentor *Abhishek Sharma* and started contributing.

## My Contributions:
### **Pull Request #1:**
So I was setting up the development environment and just noticed that the project was not ignore the files generated by Pycharm IDE and guess what I just made my first contribution by adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">.idea</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/venv</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> file.

### **Pull Request #2:**

I was going through the issues and selected issue **#29**. In this I had to implement a validation to check wether the inputted ip is valid or not. So I used regular expression and created a small check function for ip addresses.
